## Audits

The `/audits` folder contains all audits of the Solidity Source Code for Tru Reputation Token- whether that is generated by tools such as **[Oyente Audits](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente)** (contained in the `/audits/oyente` folder), Penetration Testing or Manual Code Reviews.

## Testing and Code Coverage

The Tru Reputation Token Project has a complete Unit Testing Suite and publicly visible Code Coverage Reports. These reports are generated using [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) and can be accessed on the [Tru Reputation Token Coveralls Page](https://coveralls.io/github/TruLtd/tru-reputation-token).

## Tru DevNet Information

For your convenience, a [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth) genesis.json has been included in this Project, along with a `./scripts/devnet.sh` script (and associated NPM Run Scripts) to allow a test Geth Network to demonstrate and test the Tru Reputation Token, in addition to the TestRPC configurations used for Basic Unit Testing.

## NPM Run Scripts

The following Scripts have been added to the package.json to ease the usage of this project:

| Command | Description | Associated Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compile` | Executes `truffle compile` to compile the Solidity source code | N/A |
| `coverage` | Generates the Coverage reports leveraging the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `coverage.sh` |
| `clean` | Cleans the compiled Solidity code from the `./build` | N/A |
| `postinstall` | Refreshes the dependencies of the Project that rely on sub-projects (like Open-Zeppelin) | `build.sh` |
| `add-devnet-acct` | Adds a new account to the **Tru-Devnet Network** once it has been created in Geth. | `devnet.sh` |
| `console-devnet` | Runs the `truffle console` command against the **Tru-Devnet Network** | `devnet.sh` |
| `create-devnet` | Creates the **Tru-Devnet Network** using Geth. | `devnet.sh` |
| `migrate-devnet` | Executes `truffle migrate` command to compile and import the Contracts into **Tru-Devnet Network**. | `devnet.sh` |
| `limit-devnet` | Used to de-prioritise the CPU Priority of the Geth Process running the **Tru-Devnet Network** to prevent Mining causing performance issues on development desktops. | `devnet.sh` |
| `restore-devnet` | Used to restore the normal CPU Priority of the Geth Process running the **Tru-Devnet Network**. | `devnet.sh` |
| `start-devnet` | Starts the **Tru-Devnet Network** | `devnet.sh` |
| `stop-devnet` | Stops the **Tru-Devnet Network** | `devnet.sh` |
| `test-devnet` | Executes the Test Suite against **Tru-Devnet Network** using `truffle test` | `devnet.sh` |
| `test` | Executes the Test Suite against the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `testnet.sh` |
| `console-testnet` | Runs the `truffle console` command against the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `testnet.sh` |
| `migrate-testnet` | Runs the `truffle migrate` command to compile and import the Contracts into the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `testnet.sh` |
| `restart-testnet` | Restarts & Resets the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `testnet.sh` |
| `start-testnet` | Starts the **TestNet TestRPC Network** | `testnet.sh` |
